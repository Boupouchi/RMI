# RMI
The project is a comprehensive solution for managing rooms and machines using an intuitive Swing graphical user interface. It uses Hibernate as the persistence layer for secure and organized data storage and employs Remote Method Invocation (RMI) for seamless client-server communication. The project consists of two main components: the RMI server and the RMI client, each serving distinct roles to provide a unified room and machine management system.

The RMI server handles CRUD operations for machines and rooms, maintaining data structure and organization. Hibernate is used for data persistence, ensuring data integrity and reliable data retrieval. The RMI server contains business logic responsible for processing requests, executing database operations, and returning relevant data.

The RMI client offers a user-friendly interface for users to perform tasks like creating, reading, updating, and deleting machines and rooms. Users can efficiently search for available machines in each room, enhancing the user experience and streamlining the booking process. The RMI client communicates with the RMI server, forwarding user requests and displaying responses, providing a seamless and responsive interface.
